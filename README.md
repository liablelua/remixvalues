# Modded Assassin Value List Open-Source
Yeah, you heard that. A modded asssassin value-list custom website that is open-sourced!<br>I haven't heard of this sense <i>Assassin Project</i> had its own website!.
## What was this for.
I'm using this for Assassin Remix! (Owned by Rylan)<br>This is so the Value List people have better tools to work with.
## How to run
Open up your ports or use a VPS.<br>You only need to open Port 3000.<br>Run this command:
```git
git clone https://github.com/liablelua/remixvalues
```
Make sure you have the latest version of NPM and a version higher than 13 for Next.js
```bat
cd values
npm install
```
This will install all needed dependences.<br>Once thats over all you need to do is run this command:
```bat
node server.js
```
